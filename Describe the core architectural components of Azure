Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
	• Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
	• Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
	• Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.
	
	
Region pairs:
Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. 
This approach allows for the replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect an entire region. 

Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure.
